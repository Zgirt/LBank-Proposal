# Exchange Listings Proposal

## Request to CCF to approve **38.23B Qubic** ($45,000 Qubics for listings on LBank + $20,000 for the initial MM)

### Proposal

**Available Options:**  
- **Option 0:** No, I don’t want  
- **Option 1:** Yes, approve the requested amount  

### Details

We have the opportunity to list **QUBIC** on **LBank** ([LBank on CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/lbank/)) under the following conditions:

#### **Costs**
- **$45,000** for listing  
- **$20,000** for market making, split into:  
  - **$10,000** in **QUBIC**  
  - **$10,000** in **USDT**  
  *(Both can be recovered after 30 days when there is sufficient volume.)*

LBank is an exchange ranked **#17** on CoinMarketCap. The exchange is based in the **British Virgin Islands** and is owned and operated by **LBK Blockchain Co., Limited**. It also has offices in **Lithuania, Canada, and Singapore**.

For other tokens like **KAS**, LBank provides a daily trading volume exceeding **$10M**, which could be beneficial for increasing **QUBIC’s** daily trading volume.

Normally, LBank requires full payment upfront, but we have negotiated an initial payment of **$25K**, with the remaining **$20K** to be paid once **QUBIC** is integrated.

For this reason, we are requesting **$65K in QUBIC** at the current price of **$2300 per billion**.  
_All funds will be used for the listing, and in case of a price increase in QUBIC, the excess funds will be returned to the CCF._

### **Listing Costs**
- **Amount:** 38.23 bln QUBIC @1750/bln, around **$65,000**
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks after payment for the **QUBIC** integration on spot

### **QU Donation Address**
